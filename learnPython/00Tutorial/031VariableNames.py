# Variable Names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
myvar = "yuandre"
my_var = "yuandre"
_my_var = "yuandre"
myVar = "yuandre"
MYVAR = "yuandre"
myvar2 = "yuandre"

# Illegal variable names:
# 2myvar = "yuandre"
# my-var = "yuandre"
# my var = "yuandre"
# Remember that variable names are case-sensitive

# Multi Words Variable Names
#  Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
#  There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

# Camel Case
myVariableName = "yuandre"

# Pascal Case
MyVariableName = "yuandre"

# Snake Case
my_variable_name = "yuandre"
